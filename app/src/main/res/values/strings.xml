Time will pass, and we\'ll be on our way.\n\
As the years go by there will be\n\
Happiest of memories\, rah rah rah!\n\
Stand and then we\'ll sing this song again.\n\
All you loyal men\nSing the praises of our order.\n\
Sing up you men of AZA\, up you men of AZA!\n\
\n\
Brothers we\'ll be as we share our cares each day,\n\
Happy and free though the years go on their way.\n\
Starting anew face to face with destiny,\n\
Hearts beating true for the friends and loves to be.\n\

        We believe in AZA!\n\
        With voices loud we say we\'re proud of the A-Z-Aleph Tzadik Aleph.\n\
        We all know that Jewish life had its share of trouble and strife\,\n\
        But we\'ll never cease to work for peace in the AZ Aleph Tzadik Aleph.\n\
        \n\
        Brotherly love and charity\,\n\
        we cherish and promote harmony and democracy.\n\
        Jewish life will never stray\,\n\
        Bne\'i Brith is on its way\,\n\
        And it all began with Sam Bieber\'s plan for the AZ Aleph Tzadik Aleph.  </string>

    <string name="azaallthewaytext">Aleph brothers of the order!\n\
We\'re all jewish boys, some young and some older.\n\
Life is great here, greater than NIFTY!\n\
We support each other, we\'re a fraternity.\n\

AZA all the way\n\
For tomorrow and today\n\
For the chapter, and what we\'re after\n\
AZA all the way\n\

All my memories gather round her.\n\
She\'s a BBG and the one I\'m after.\n\

\n\
AZA all the way\n\
For tomorrow and today\n\
For the chapter, and what we\'re after\n\
AZA all the way\n\
\n\
I hear the prayers in the evening at havdallah;\n\
Traditions remind me that I\'m in AZA.\n\
And as we sing Air Force Ranger our bonds grow stronger each and every single day, and we say\n\

    <string name="proudtobeanalephtext">If tomorrow I\'d be facing death, and saying goodbye to life\n\
I\'d be looking at the Israelis in the South bay,\n\
And the East bay growing hyphe (like hyphy).\n\
I\'d be looking back at my time in AZA\n\
And the seven cardinal principles that I live by everyday!\n\
\n\
So I\'m proud to be an Aleph, where I have fraternity.\n\
And I won\'t forget the memories and the sexy BBGs.\n\
So I proudly stand up with my fellow Jews during havdallah on saturdays.\n\
\'Cuz I love my brother alephs and I love AZA!\n\
\n\
From MoAd to Saratoga, to Sunnyvale\'s JSZ\n\
From Peninsula AZA, to Machar and DBG\n\
From San Fran down to Ramon, and SiWi to LHA (and Chai)\n\
We\'re all connected by Cal-Train and Bart and by being from the Bay.\n\
\n\
So I\'m proud to be an Aleph, where I have fraternity.\n\
And I won\'t forget the memories and the sexy BBGs.\n\
So I proudly stand up with my fellow Jews during havdallah on saturdays.\n\
\'Cuz I love my brother alephs and I love AZA!\n\
\n\
So I\'m proud to be in AZA, where everyone accepts me.\n\
And I won\'t forget the cool events and the sexy BBGs.\n\
So I raise my hand up and teach prospectives the handshake of AZA.\n\
